# Kubernetes Container Orchestration

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

## Core Concepts

### Cluster
- Set of nodes running containerized applications
- Master node controls the cluster
- Worker nodes run the applications

### Pods
- Smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes
- Can contain one or more containers
- Shared storage and network

### Services
- Stable network endpoint for pods
- Load balancing across pods
- Service discovery

### Deployments
- Manage replica sets and pods
- Rolling updates and rollbacks
- Declarative configuration

## Key Components

### Master Node Components
- **API Server**: Central management point
- **etcd**: Distributed key-value store
- **Scheduler**: Assigns pods to nodes
- **Controller Manager**: Manages cluster state

### Worker Node Components
- **kubelet**: Node agent
- **kube-proxy**: Network proxy
- **Container Runtime**: Docker, containerd, etc.

## Resource Management

### CPU and Memory
- Resource requests and limits
- Quality of Service (QoS) classes
- Resource quotas

### Storage
- Persistent Volumes (PVs)
- Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs)
- Storage classes

### Networking
- Pod-to-pod communication
- Service networking
- Ingress controllers

## Configuration Management

### ConfigMaps
- Store configuration data
- Decouple configuration from code
- Environment-specific settings

### Secrets
- Store sensitive data
- Encrypted at rest
- Base64 encoded

### Namespaces
- Virtual clusters within a cluster
- Resource isolation
- Access control

## Scaling and Updates

### Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)
- Automatically scale pods based on metrics
- CPU and memory utilization
- Custom metrics support

### Rolling Updates
- Zero-downtime deployments
- Gradual replacement of pods
- Automatic rollback on failure

### Blue-Green Deployments
- Two identical production environments
- Switch traffic between environments
- Instant rollback capability

## Monitoring and Logging

### Metrics
- Resource utilization
- Application performance
- Custom metrics

### Logging
- Centralized log collection
- Log aggregation and analysis
- Structured logging

### Health Checks
- Liveness probes
- Readiness probes
- Startup probes

## Security

### RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
- Fine-grained permissions
- Service accounts
- Cluster and namespace scopes

### Network Policies
- Control pod-to-pod communication
- Network segmentation
- Security groups

### Pod Security Standards
- Security contexts
- Pod security policies
- Runtime security

## Popular Tools

### Helm
- Package manager for Kubernetes
- Charts for application deployment
- Template engine

### Istio
- Service mesh platform
- Traffic management
- Security and observability

### Prometheus
- Monitoring and alerting
- Time-series database
- Grafana integration

## Best Practices

### Resource Management
- Set appropriate resource limits
- Use resource quotas
- Monitor resource usage

### Security
- Implement RBAC
- Use network policies
- Regular security updates

### Monitoring
- Comprehensive monitoring
- Alerting on critical metrics
- Log aggregation and analysis
