# Mobile App Development

Mobile app development is the process of creating software applications that run on mobile devices.

## Development Approaches

### Native Development
- Platform-specific languages and tools
- **iOS**: Swift or Objective-C with Xcode
- **Android**: Java or Kotlin with Android Studio
- Best performance and platform integration

### Cross-Platform Development
- Single codebase for multiple platforms
- **React Native**: JavaScript-based framework
- **Flutter**: Dart-based framework by Google
- **Xamarin**: C#-based Microsoft framework

### Hybrid Development
- Web technologies wrapped in native container
- **Ionic**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Cordova/PhoneGap**: WebView-based apps
- Faster development, limited performance

## iOS Development

### Programming Languages
- **Swift**: Modern, safe, and fast
- **Objective-C**: Legacy language, still supported

### Key Frameworks
- **UIKit**: User interface framework
- **SwiftUI**: Declarative UI framework
- **Core Data**: Data persistence
- **Core Location**: Location services

### Development Tools
- **Xcode**: Integrated development environment
- **Simulator**: iOS device simulation
- **TestFlight**: Beta testing platform

## Android Development

### Programming Languages
- **Kotlin**: Preferred language (since 2017)
- **Java**: Traditional language, still supported

### Key Components
- **Activities**: Single screen with user interface
- **Services**: Background processes
- **Broadcast Receivers**: System event handling
- **Content Providers**: Data sharing between apps

### Development Tools
- **Android Studio**: Official IDE
- **Emulator**: Android device simulation
- **Play Console**: App publishing and management

## App Architecture Patterns

### MVC (Model-View-Controller)
- Separates data, presentation, and logic
- Traditional pattern
- Good for simple apps

### MVP (Model-View-Presenter)
- View and Presenter are decoupled
- Better testability
- Common in Android development

### MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- Data binding between View and ViewModel
- Reactive programming
- Popular with modern frameworks

## Testing Strategies

### Unit Testing
- Test individual components
- Fast execution
- High coverage

### Integration Testing
- Test component interactions
- API testing
- Database testing

### UI Testing
- Test user interactions
- Automated testing
- Cross-device testing

## App Store Guidelines

### iOS App Store
- Human Interface Guidelines
- App Review Guidelines
- Privacy requirements

### Google Play Store
- Material Design guidelines
- Content policies
- Quality requirements
