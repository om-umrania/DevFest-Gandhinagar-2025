# Machine Learning Basics

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on algorithms that can learn and make decisions from data.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning
Supervised learning uses labeled training data to learn a mapping function from inputs to outputs.

Examples include:
- Linear regression
- Decision trees
- Neural networks

### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns in data without labeled examples.

Common techniques:
- Clustering (K-means, hierarchical)
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE)
- Association rules

### Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning learns through interaction with an environment using rewards and penalties.

## Key Concepts

### Features and Labels
- **Features**: Input variables used to make predictions
- **Labels**: The target variable we want to predict

### Training and Testing
- **Training set**: Data used to train the model
- **Test set**: Data used to evaluate model performance

### Overfitting and Underfitting
- **Overfitting**: Model performs well on training data but poorly on new data
- **Underfitting**: Model is too simple to capture underlying patterns

## Popular Algorithms

1. **Linear Regression**: Predicts continuous values
2. **Logistic Regression**: Predicts categorical outcomes
3. **Random Forest**: Ensemble method using multiple decision trees
4. **Support Vector Machines**: Finds optimal boundary between classes
5. **Neural Networks**: Inspired by biological neural networks
