# Agile Development Methodology

Agile is an iterative approach to software development that emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and rapid delivery of working software.

## Agile Manifesto

### Core Values
1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan

### Principles
- Customer satisfaction through early delivery
- Welcome changing requirements
- Deliver working software frequently
- Business and developers work together daily
- Build projects around motivated individuals
- Face-to-face conversation is most effective
- Working software is primary measure of progress
- Sustainable development pace
- Continuous attention to technical excellence
- Simplicity is essential
- Self-organizing teams
- Regular reflection and adaptation

## Scrum Framework

### Roles
- **Product Owner**: Defines requirements and priorities
- **Scrum Master**: Facilitates the process
- **Development Team**: Builds the product

### Events
- **Sprint Planning**: Plan work for the sprint
- **Daily Standup**: Daily team synchronization
- **Sprint Review**: Demonstrate completed work
- **Sprint Retrospective**: Reflect and improve

### Artifacts
- **Product Backlog**: Prioritized list of features
- **Sprint Backlog**: Work selected for current sprint
- **Increment**: Working software delivered

## Sprint Cycle

### Sprint Planning
- Select items from product backlog
- Break down into tasks
- Estimate effort required
- Commit to sprint goals

### Daily Standup
- What did you do yesterday?
- What will you do today?
- Are there any impediments?

### Sprint Review
- Demonstrate completed features
- Gather feedback from stakeholders
- Update product backlog
- Plan next sprint

### Sprint Retrospective
- What went well?
- What could be improved?
- Action items for next sprint

## User Stories

### Format
"As a [user type], I want [functionality] so that [benefit]"

### Examples
- As a customer, I want to search for products so that I can find what I need
- As a admin, I want to manage user accounts so that I can control access
- As a developer, I want automated testing so that I can ensure quality

### Acceptance Criteria
- Given [context]
- When [action]
- Then [expected result]

## Estimation Techniques

### Story Points
- Relative sizing
- Based on complexity, effort, uncertainty
- Fibonacci sequence: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13

### Planning Poker
- Team estimates together
- Discuss differences
- Reach consensus
- Avoid anchoring bias

### Velocity
- Story points completed per sprint
- Used for sprint planning
- Historical data for forecasting

## Kanban Method

### Visual Management
- Kanban board
- Work in progress limits
- Flow visualization
- Continuous improvement

### Principles
- Visualize work
- Limit work in progress
- Manage flow
- Make policies explicit
- Implement feedback loops
- Improve collaboratively

## Benefits

### Faster Delivery
- Shorter development cycles
- Early feedback
- Quick adaptation to changes

### Better Quality
- Continuous testing
- Regular reviews
- Early bug detection

### Improved Collaboration
- Cross-functional teams
- Regular communication
- Shared responsibility

### Customer Satisfaction
- Regular demos
- Feedback incorporation
- Value delivery

## Challenges

### Cultural Change
- Resistance to change
- New mindset required
- Training and support needed

### Estimation Accuracy
- Difficult to estimate accurately
- Learning curve
- Changing requirements

### Team Dynamics
- Self-organization challenges
- Skill gaps
- Communication issues

## Best Practices

### Start Small
- Begin with pilot projects
- Learn and adapt
- Scale gradually

### Invest in Training
- Team education
- Skill development
- Continuous learning

### Use Tools
- Project management tools
- Collaboration platforms
- Development tools

### Regular Retrospectives
- Continuous improvement
- Process refinement
- Team development
