# Blockchain Technology

Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that maintains a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography.

## Core Concepts

### Distributed Ledger
- Decentralized database
- Shared across multiple nodes
- No single point of failure

### Cryptography
- **Hash Functions**: One-way mathematical functions
- **Digital Signatures**: Verify authenticity
- **Merkle Trees**: Efficient data verification

### Consensus Mechanisms
- **Proof of Work (PoW)**: Bitcoin's approach
- **Proof of Stake (PoS)**: Ethereum 2.0
- **Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)**: EOS
- **Proof of Authority (PoA)**: Private blockchains

## Key Features

### Immutability
- Once recorded, data cannot be altered
- Cryptographic hashing ensures integrity
- Historical record preservation

### Transparency
- Public blockchains are transparent
- All transactions are visible
- Open source code

### Decentralization
- No central authority
- Peer-to-peer network
- Distributed decision making

## Blockchain Types

### Public Blockchains
- Open to anyone
- Bitcoin, Ethereum
- Fully decentralized
- Permissionless

### Private Blockchains
- Restricted access
- Enterprise use cases
- Centralized control
- Permissioned

### Consortium Blockchains
- Controlled by group of organizations
- Hybrid approach
- Shared governance
- Industry-specific

## Smart Contracts

### Definition
- Self-executing contracts
- Code stored on blockchain
- Automatic execution when conditions met

### Benefits
- Automation
- Trust and transparency
- Reduced intermediaries
- Cost efficiency

### Use Cases
- Supply chain management
- Insurance claims
- Real estate transactions
- Voting systems

## Cryptocurrencies

### Bitcoin
- First cryptocurrency
- Digital gold
- Store of value
- Limited supply (21 million)

### Ethereum
- Smart contract platform
- Programmable blockchain
- Decentralized applications (DApps)
- Ether (ETH) as native currency

### Other Major Cryptocurrencies
- **Litecoin**: Faster Bitcoin alternative
- **Ripple (XRP)**: Payment protocol
- **Cardano**: Academic approach
- **Polkadot**: Interoperability focus

## Applications

### Financial Services
- Cross-border payments
- Decentralized finance (DeFi)
- Tokenization of assets
- Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs)

### Supply Chain
- Product traceability
- Authenticity verification
- Quality assurance
- Compliance tracking

### Healthcare
- Patient data management
- Drug traceability
- Medical records
- Research data sharing

### Identity Management
- Digital identity
- KYC/AML compliance
- Self-sovereign identity
- Privacy protection
